# Le CV and Job Offer Analyzer

## Introduction

"Le CV and Job Offer Analyzer" is a web application built with Flask that automates the analysis and matching of CVs (curricula vitae) with job offers. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and Google's Generative AI API to extract key information from PDF files, such as skills, experience, and education. The application then calculates the similarity between a CV and a job offer to determine the candidate's suitability for a specific position. Results are stored in a MySQL database, and users receive feedback in the form of a score and an acceptance or rejection status.
